# A Docker Container for a generic *Vim*

Currently I use this code to build a *Docker* image that I then use as a "base" for other images. 
For example the `paullamar3/docker-vim-mkdnedt` project builds on this one to produce a container
specifically designed for editing markdown documents.

> WARNING: This is a project in progress. I may decide to eventually reorganize my *Docker* image hierarchy,
> in which case this project might go away. If this project survives, I will publish a *release* with more 
> information on use and configuration.
